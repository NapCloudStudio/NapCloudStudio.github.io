      <h2>Past Works</h2>
      <p>
        My life has been full of ups and downs but each experience was worth it.
        Although I have not worked many jobs I have worked as Student Ambassador
        for Portland State University, A Video Manager, IT Student Interm, and
        my current work as a Processing Technican. Each job radically different
        but offered me a lot of skills that are very helpful in my life.
